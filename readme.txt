Apply a duotone effect to photos in the media library.

== Description ==

Inspired by the duotone effect employed in the [*Twotone*](https://audiotheme.com/view/twotone/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_content=twotonefx-readme&utm_campaign=plugins) theme, <em>Twotone FX</em> makes it easy to preview and apply a similar filter to any photo in your Media Library.

= Accessing the Image Editor =

Visit the Media Library at <em>Media &rarr; Library</em> in your admin panel.

If you're using the default <strong>Grid Mode</strong>:

1. Click an image to open the <strong>Attachment Details</strong> popup
2. Click the <strong>Edit Image</strong> button below the image
3. Scroll the right sidebar down to the <strong>Twotone Effect</strong> section

If you're using the <strong>List Mode</strong>:

1. Click an image to open the <strong>Edit Attachment</strong> screen
2. Click the <strong>Edit Image</strong> button below the image
3. Find the <strong>Twotone Effect</strong> section

<em>It's also possible to access the image editor in the Media Manager popup when editing any post or page.</em>

= Applying the Twotone Effect =

The <strong>Twotone Effect</strong> section in the image editor consists of two color pickers and a button for applying the filter to the image to preview it before saving your changes.

The <strong>Starting Color</strong> replaces shadows in the image, so choosing a dark color usually produces the best results.

The <strong>Ending Color</strong> replaces highlights in the image. Choose a lighter color that contrasts with the starting color for the best results.

After choosing colors, preview the image by clicking the <strong>Apply</strong> button. If you don't like the way the effect turned out, you can either use the <strong>Undo</strong> button on the image editor toolbar, or select different colors and apply them.

Your changes won't be made permanent until you click the <strong>Save</strong> button.

== Notes ==

= How It works =

Behind the scenes, a gradient map is generated representing values between the starting and ending colors selected for the filter. The photo is then converted to grayscale and each pixel is mapped to one of the colors in the gradient map based on its brightness.

Two methods for editing images are available to support different server environments:

* <em>ImageMagick</em> is the preferred method and provides the best performance.
* A <em>GD Graphics Library</em> implementation is provided as a fallback, however, it can be resource intensive and may exhaust memory on some shared hosts, especially when processing large photos.
